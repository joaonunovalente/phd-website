      Hi there! <br>
      My name is <b>João Nuno Valente</b>, and I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Aveiro in Portugal.
      My research focuses on 3D vibrometry using RGBD cameras for position estimation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before embarking on my PhD, I completed an integrated Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at the same institution.

<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
  I also spent a year in Udine, Italy, doing ERASMUS. 
  I was involved in an organization called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestaveiro.web.ua.pt/">BEST Aveiro</a>, where I had the opportunity to participate in several events and coordinate one of its local engineering competition, EBEC.
</p>
<p>
  Besides that, I used to play chess and was part of the university team. 
  Nowadays, I am retired, but I can still play a game or two on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lichess.org/@/joaovalente">Lichess</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chess.com/member/joaovalente">Chess.com</a>.

      The Department of Mechanical Engineering (DEM) at the University of Aveiro is a hub for innovation, research, and advanced education in mechanical engineering.

  It was here that I earned my integrated master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I focused my dissertation on mechanical vibrations by developing a low-cost wireless system using MEMS accelerometers and ESP32 microcontrollers.
</p>
<h5>Master Thesis</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom: -2px;">
  The accelerometers captured mechanical vibrations, which were processed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract frequency-domain information for Modal Analysis.
</p>
<div class="row align-items-center ">
  <!-- Text Column -->
  <div class="col-md-7 align-items-center ">
    <p>
      The ESP32 microcontrollers handled both data acquisition and signal processing, making them efficient for vibration analysis.  
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure seamless wireless communication, I implemented an ad hoc mesh network, allowing real-time data transmission between sensor nodes without a central hub.
