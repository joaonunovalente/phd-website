	abstract = {An effective 3D descriptor should be invariant to different geometric transformations, such as scale and rotation, robust to occlusions and clutter, and capable of generalising to different application domains. We present a simple yet effective method to learn general and distinctive 3D local descriptors that can be used to register point clouds that are captured in different domains. Point cloud patches are extracted, canonicalised with respect to their local reference frame, and encoded into scale and rotation-invariant compact descriptors by a deep neural network that is invariant to permutations of the input points. This design is what enables our descriptors to generalise across domains. We evaluate and compare our descriptors with alternative handcrafted and deep learning-based descriptors on several indoor and outdoor datasets that are reconstructed by using both RGBD sensors and laser scanners. Our descriptors outperform most recent descriptors by a large margin in terms of generalisation, and also become the state of the art in benchmarks where training and testing are performed in the same domain.},

	abstract = {Matching local geometric features on real-world depth images is a challenging task due to the noisy, low-resolution, and incomplete nature of 3D scan data. These difficulties limit the performance of current state-of-art methods, which are typically based on histograms over geometric properties. In this paper, we present 3DMatch, a data-driven model that learns a local volumetric patch descriptor for establishing correspondences between partial 3D data. To amass training data for our model, we propose a self-supervised feature learning method that leverages the millions of correspondence labels found in existing RGB-D reconstructions. Experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to match local geometry in new scenes for reconstruction, but also generalize to different tasks and spatial scales (e.g. instance-level object model alignment for the Amazon Picking Challenge, and mesh surface correspondence). Results show that 3DMatch consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.

	abstract = {We study the problem of extracting accurate correspondences for point cloud registration. Recent keypoint-free methods have shown great potential through bypassing the detection of repeatable keypoints which is difficult to do especially in low-overlap scenarios. They seek correspondences over downsampled superpoints, which are then propagated to dense points. Superpoints are matched based on whether their neighboring patches overlap. Such sparse and loose matching requires contextual features capturing the geometric structure of the point clouds. We propose Geometric Transformer, or GeoTransformer for short, to learn geometric feature for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it invariant to rigid transformation and robust in low-overlap cases. The simplistic design attains surprisingly high matching accuracy such that no RANSAC is required in the estimation of alignment transformation, leading to \$100\$ times acceleration. Extensive experiments on rich benchmarks encompassing indoor, outdoor, synthetic, multiway and non-rigid demonstrate the efficacy of GeoTransformer. Notably, our method improves the inlier ratio by \$18\{{\textbackslash}sim\}31\$ percentage points and the registration recall by over \$7\$ points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.

This problem involves finding a rigid transformation from one point cloud into another so that they align. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants provide simple and easily-implemented iterative methods for this task, but these algorithms can converge to spurious local optima. To address local optima and other difficulties in the ICP pipeline, we propose a learning-based method, titled Deep Closest Point (DCP), inspired by recent techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our model consists of three parts: a point cloud embedding network, an attention-based module combined with a pointer generation layer, to approximate combinatorial matching, and a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer to extract the final rigid transformation. We train our model end-to-end on the ModelNet40 dataset and show in several settings that it performs better than ICP, its variants (e.g., Go-ICP, FGR), and the recently-proposed learning-based method PointNetLK. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art registration technique, we evaluate the suitability of our learned features transferred to unseen objects. We also provide preliminary analysis of our learned model to help understand whether domain-specific and/or global features facilitate rigid registration.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Recent 3D registration methods are mostly learning-based that either find correspondences in feature space and match them, or directly estimate the registration transformation from the given point cloud features. Therefore, these feature-based methods have difficulties with generalizing onto point clouds that differ substantially from their training data. This issue is not so apparent because of the problematic benchmark definitions that cannot provide any in-depth analysis and contain a bias toward similar data. Therefore, we propose a methodology to create a 3D registration benchmark, given a point cloud dataset, that provides a more informative evaluation of a method w.r.t. other benchmarks. Using this methodology, we create a novel FAUST-partial (FP) benchmark, based on the FAUST dataset, with several difficulty levels. The FP benchmark addresses the limitations of the current benchmarks: lack of data and parameter range variability, and allows to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a 3D registration method w.r.t. a single registration parameter. Using the new FP benchmark, we provide a thorough analysis of the current state-of-the-art methods and observe that the current method still struggle to generalize onto severely different out-of-sample data. Therefore, we propose a simple featureless traditional 3D registration baseline method based on the weighted cross-correlation between two given point clouds. Our method achieves strong results on current benchmarking datasets, outperforming most deep learning methods. Our source code is available on github.com/DavidBoja/exhaustive-grid-search.},

	abstract = {Continuous Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry (CSLDV) methods Ô¨Årst appeared in the literature in the early 1990s and over the past three decades they have undergone an evolution in terms of procedures and applications which constitute a new state-of-the-art now described in this review paper. The advances in vibration measurement performed by Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometers augmented the capability of measuring vibration data from a grid of a few hundred measurement points to a single scan which traverses and measures at many thousands of points on the same structure. The deÔ¨Çection shapes of vibration modes can be created by assembling two pieces of information from a scanning measurement - temporal and spatial - and the more measurement ‚Äòpoints‚Äô, the better the spatial density and resolution of the deÔ¨Çection shape(s). The introduction of Continuous Scanning techniques challenged the traditional principle that the number of measurement points deÔ¨Ånes the spatial deÔ¨Ånition of the deÔ¨Çection shape. Thereafter, high deÔ¨Ånition deÔ¨Çection shapes could be achieved by measuring a single time series from a continuously sweeping trajectory covering the same surface area that would traditionally be covered by a set of Ô¨Åxed-point measurements, each of which spans a range of frequencies. The CSLDV approach compresses both the temporal oscillation and the spatial distribution of the deÔ¨Çection shape into one LDV output-modulated signal, whereby the harmonic oscillation and the spatial distribution across a swept area were now deÔ¨Åned by a central response harmonic and its sidebands. This change of perspective in vibration measurements from the conventional stepped-scan method to the continuous-scan approach allowed several researchers to exploit and expand the potential of the scanning vibrometer further than its initial design speciÔ¨Åcations. This paper starts with the raison d‚Äô√™tre, with a brief historical account of how vibration measurements have developed over the past decades, and then moves to the theoretical background and applications of the CSLDV approach. Finally, the paper presents a philosophical and technical account of the research work carried out by several colleagues over the past thirty years and aims to provide a chronological order to the various advancements that CSLDV techniques offer in engineering structural dynamics. √ì 2021 The Authors.
